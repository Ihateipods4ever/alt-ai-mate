# ALT-AI-MATE Multi-Model Setup - Testing Guide

## Problem Solved ✅

The "unauthorized" error you were experiencing was actually a **quota exceeded** error from Google's Gemini API. Your API key is valid, but you've hit the rate limits for the free tier on certain models.

## What I've Implemented

### 1. Multi-AI Provider Support
- **Google Gemini**: gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-pro
- **OpenAI**: gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo  
- **Anthropic Claude**: claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet, claude-3-haiku

### 2. API Key Management
- New Settings page with secure API key storage
- Keys stored locally in browser (localStorage)
- Visual indicators for configured/missing keys
- Easy links to get API keys from each provider

### 3. Enhanced UI
- Model selection with availability indicators
- Warning messages for missing API keys
- Provider badges and status indicators
- Direct link to settings from project creation

### 4. Server Updates
- Support for all three AI providers
- Dynamic API key handling
- Better error messages with details
- New `/api/models` endpoint

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
cd /Users/localho5t/Desktop/alt-ai-mate/packages/server
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
npm start
```

### 2. Start the Client
```bash
cd /Users/localho5t/Desktop/alt-ai-mate/packages/client
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && nvm use
npm run dev
```

### 3. Configure API Keys
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/app/settings
2. Add your API keys for the providers you want to use:
   - **Gemini**: Your current key works, but try gemini-1.5-flash instead of gemini-1.5-pro
   - **OpenAI**: Get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - **Anthropic**: Get from https://console.anthropic.com/

### 4. Test Code Generation
1. Go to "New Project" 
2. Select a model that has an API key configured
3. Try generating code

## Working Models with Your Current Setup

✅ **gemini-1.5-flash** - Works with your current API key
✅ **gemini-pro** - Should work with your current API key
❌ **gemini-1.5-pro** - Quota exceeded (rate limited)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Try Gemini 1.5 Flash**: It's faster and has higher quotas
2. **Get OpenAI API Key**: Add $5-10 credit for reliable access
3. **Get Anthropic API Key**: Claude models are excellent for coding
4. **Monitor Usage**: Check your quotas in each provider's console

## API Key URLs
- **Google Gemini**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys  
- **Anthropic**: https://console.anthropic.com/

The app now supports all major AI providers and will clearly show you which models are available based on your configured API keys!
